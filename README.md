# John's Sms Bomber
A very, very simple sms bomber written in python.  
I realized that this repo was getting some decent traffic from google which means there are some non-devs finding this, so for this reason, I made the code even cleaner and easier to config. If you have no idea what to do with this, and were looking for a simple program with UI, well, you're going to want to google "how to run python on windows/mac"; However, Mac already comes with python. If you have a Mac, just download the .py file here to Desktop, open terminal and run ```cd Desktop``` then ```python JohnsTextBomber.py``` after you've edited the CONFIG of course  
  
###CONFIG
If you have no idea what an smtp server is, and you're not using gmail, check this link:   https://www.arclab.com/en/kb/email/list-of-smtp-and-pop3-servers-mailserver-list.html  
  
You'll notice that you need the target email address. Here is a cool website:  
http://freecarrierlookup.com  
Type in number, and it will resolve it to an mms email that you can paste in config  
  
###Important:  
You must have support for "less secure apps" set to "turn on" on your Gmail. Here is the link to do so: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps  
  
###Have fun!
